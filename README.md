#TAnalyzer  
Analysis of twitter archives through sentiment and topics. Download your twitter archive at <a href="http://twitter.com/settings/account">http://twitter.com/settings/account</a> and upload to the app to get your tweets analyzed. No data is stored in the process, it is wiped automatically as shown in *app.rb*.  

#What is it?
Includes a class (*tanalyzer.rb*) and the rest is a Sinatra app viewable at <a href="http://twitter.will3942.com">http://twitter.will3942.com</a>
